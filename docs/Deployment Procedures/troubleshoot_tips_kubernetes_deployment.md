# Troubleshooting Kubernetes Deployments: Common Issues and Solutions

## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications, but it can be complex. This document identifies common issues encountered during Kubernetes deployments and provides troubleshooting tips to help resolve them.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Pod Failures**

**Symptoms:**
- Pods are in `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error` state.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Application Errors:**
    - **Solution:** Check the application logs to diagnose errors.

      ```bash
      kubectl logs <pod-name>
      ```

- **Incorrect Configuration:**
    - **Solution:** Verify that environment variables, secrets, and ConfigMaps are correctly configured and mounted.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
      ```

- **Resource Limits:**
    - **Solution:** Ensure resource requests and limits are appropriately set to prevent resource exhaustion.

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "512Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "1Gi"
          cpu: "500m"
      ```

### 2. **Deployment Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Deployments are stuck in `Pending`, `Progressing`, or `Failed` state.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Insufficient Resources:**
    - **Solution:** Check if there are enough resources available in the cluster.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
      ```

- **Image Pull Errors:**
    - **Solution:** Verify that the Docker image exists in the registry and that the credentials (if required) are correct.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep "Failed to pull image"
      ```

- **Deployment Strategy Issues:**
    - **Solution:** Ensure deployment strategies and rolling updates are correctly defined.

      ```yaml
      strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 1
          maxSurge: 1
      ```

### 3. **Service Exposure Problems**

**Symptoms:**
- Services are not accessible or not routing traffic correctly.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Incorrect Service Configuration:**
    - **Solution:** Verify that the Service configuration correctly selects the intended Pods and that ports are correctly mapped.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe service <service-name>
      ```

- **Load Balancer Issues:**
    - **Solution:** For `LoadBalancer` type services, ensure the external load balancer is provisioned and check for errors.

      ```bash
      kubectl get services
      ```

- **Network Policies:**
    - **Solution:** Ensure network policies are correctly configured to allow traffic between Pods and Services.

      ```bash
      kubectl get networkpolicies
      ```

### 4. **Persistent Storage Problems**

**Symptoms:**
- Pods fail to mount Persistent Volumes (PVs) or Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Volume Binding Issues:**
    - **Solution:** Check if the PVC is bound to a PV and verify the storage class and access modes.

      ```bash
      kubectl get pvc
      kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>
      ```

- **Permissions Issues:**
    - **Solution:** Ensure the Pod has the correct permissions to access the volume.

      ```yaml
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 1000
      ```

### 5. **Namespace and Resource Quota Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Resources are not created or deployed due to namespace restrictions or quotas.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Quota Exceeded:**
    - **Solution:** Check the resource quotas and limits for the namespace.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe quota -n <namespace>
      ```

- **Incorrect Namespace:**
    - **Solution:** Ensure resources are being created in the correct namespace.

      ```bash
      kubectl get all -n <namespace>
      ```

### 6. **ConfigMap and Secret Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Applications fail to start due to missing or incorrect configuration data.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Misconfigured ConfigMaps/Secrets:**
    - **Solution:** Verify the data in ConfigMaps and Secrets and ensure they are correctly referenced by Pods.

      ```bash
      kubectl get configmap
      kubectl describe configmap <configmap-name>
      kubectl get secret
      kubectl describe secret <secret-name>
      ```

### 7. **Node Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Nodes are in `NotReady` state or Pods are not scheduled due to node issues.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Node Resource Pressure:**
    - **Solution:** Check node resource usage and resolve any resource pressure or constraints.

      ```bash
      kubectl describe node <node-name>
      ```

- **Network or Disk Issues:**
    - **Solution:** Investigate network and disk health on the affected node.

### 8. **Application-Level Debugging**

**Symptoms:**
- Applications have runtime issues or bugs.

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

- **Debugging Containers:**
    - **Solution:** Use `kubectl exec` to run commands inside the container for debugging.

      ```bash
      kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
      ```

- **Live Debugging:**
    - **Solution:** Deploy debugging tools or use sidecar containers for live debugging.

## Debugging and Resolving Deployment Issues

### 1. **Check Logs and Events**

- **Pod Logs:**

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```

- **Cluster Events:**

  ```bash
  kubectl get events
  ```

### 2. **Inspect Kubernetes Resources**

- **Describe Resources:**

  ```bash
  kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name>
  ```

- **Resource Status:**

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl get deployments
  kubectl get services
  ```

### 3. **Verify Cluster Health**

- **Check Cluster Nodes:**

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl describe node <node-name>
  ```

- **Check Resource Usage:**

  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  kubectl top pods
  ```

### 4. **Use Kubernetes Dashboard and Monitoring Tools**

- **Kubernetes Dashboard:**
    - Provides a web-based UI to monitor and manage cluster resources.

- **Monitoring Tools:**
    - Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for detailed metrics and monitoring.

### 5. **Consult Documentation and Community**

- **Kubernetes Documentation:** [Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
- **Community Forums:** For additional support and troubleshooting tips.
