## 2. Docker Deployment

### 2.1. Overview

**Docker** is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Docker containers bundle application code with its dependencies, enabling consistent behavior across various environments.

### 2.2. Documentation

- **Official Documentation**: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- **Docker Hub**: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) for container images and repository management.
- **Docker Compose**: [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 2.3. Vendor Practices

- **Security**: Docker advocates for the use of minimal base images, regular vulnerability scanning, and the use of Docker Content Trust (DCT) to verify image integrity.
- **Community Support**: Docker provides extensive community forums, official training, and certification programs.
- **Updates**: Regular updates are released for Docker Engine, CLI, and Compose to improve functionality and security.

### 2.4. Technical Specifics

- **Container Runtime**: Docker uses the `containerd` runtime for managing containers.
- **Networking**: Docker supports several networking modes, including bridge, host, and overlay.
- **Storage**: Docker supports various storage drivers (e.g., `overlay2`, `aufs`) for managing container data.
- **Resource Management**: Docker allows setting CPU and memory limits for containers.

## 3. Kubernetes Deployment

### 3.1. Overview

**Kubernetes** (K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates containers across clusters of machines.

### 3.2. Documentation

- **Official Documentation**: [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
- **Kubernetes GitHub**: [Kubernetes GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- **Helm Charts**: [Helm Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/)

### 3.3. Vendor Practices

- **Security**: Kubernetes emphasizes security practices like RBAC, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies. The community and vendors offer tools for continuous security monitoring.
- **Ecosystem**: Kubernetes integrates with various tools and services (e.g., Helm for package management, Prometheus for monitoring).
- **Updates**: Kubernetes releases updates approximately every three months, including bug fixes, new features, and security patches.

### 3.4. Technical Specifics

- **Cluster Management**: Kubernetes manages clusters using API servers, controllers, and schedulers.
- **Networking**: Uses CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins for network management and supports network policies for controlling traffic.
- **Storage**: Supports dynamic provisioning of storage using PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
- **Scaling**: Provides horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities for applications and resources.

## 4. AWS (Amazon Web Services) Deployment

### 4.1. Overview

**AWS** is a comprehensive cloud services platform offering various services including computing power, storage, and databases. AWS provides managed services for container orchestration, serverless computing, and more.

### 4.2. Documentation

- **Official Documentation**: [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
- **AWS CLI**: [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
- **AWS SDKs**: [AWS SDK Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)

### 4.3. Vendor Practices

- **Security**: AWS provides tools and practices for securing infrastructure, such as IAM for access control, AWS Shield for DDoS protection, and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption.
- **Compliance**: AWS complies with various industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Support**: AWS offers different support plans including Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise, along with extensive documentation and training resources.

### 4.4. Technical Specifics

- **Compute Services**: Includes EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and Lambda for serverless computing.
- **Storage Services**: Includes S3 (Simple Storage Service), EBS (Elastic Block Store), and EFS (Elastic File System).
- **Networking**: AWS offers VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), ELB (Elastic Load Balancing), and Route 53 for DNS services.
- **Database Services**: Includes RDS (Relational Database Service), DynamoDB (NoSQL), and Aurora for high-performance databases.

## 5. Bare Metal Deployments

### 5.1. Overview

**Bare Metal** deployments refer to using physical servers rather than virtualized environments. This approach provides full control over the hardware and is often used for high-performance or specialized workloads.

### 5.2. Documentation

- **General Documentation**: [Bare Metal Servers Overview](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/bare-metal-servers)
- **Vendor Documentation**: Documentation varies by hardware and vendor (e.g., Dell, HPE, Lenovo).

### 5.3. Vendor Practices

- **Security**: Bare metal deployments require manual implementation of security practices, including patch management, physical security, and network protection.
- **Customization**: Offers high customization for hardware configurations and software installations.
- **Support**: Vendor support typically includes hardware maintenance and troubleshooting, with less focus on software stack management.

### 5.4. Technical Specifics

- **Hardware Specifications**: Involves managing server specs such as CPU, RAM, storage, and networking components.
- **Operating Systems**: Supports a range of operating systems including various distributions of Linux, Windows Server, and others.
- **Management Tools**: Utilizes tools for remote management such as IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) or vendor-specific tools for hardware monitoring and management.
