# Investigation: Bare Metal VMs as a Deployment Option

This document explores Bare Metal Virtual Machines (VMs) as a deployment option for our application. It covers their key features, advantages, and limitations, and provides examples of successful Bare Metal VM implementations.

## 1. Key Features of Bare Metal VMs

**Bare Metal VMs** are virtual machines that run directly on the physical hardware without a traditional hypervisor layer. They offer the benefits of both virtualized and dedicated environments. Here are the key features:

- **Direct Access to Hardware:** Bare Metal VMs provide direct access to the underlying physical hardware, which results in improved performance, lower latency, and more consistent compute resources.
- **Dedicated Resources:** Unlike traditional VMs, which share hardware resources with multiple tenants, Bare Metal VMs have dedicated CPU, memory, and storage resources.
- **Customizability:** They allow full customization of the server environment, from the operating system to the software stack.
- **Scalability:** Supports high scalability with the ability to handle large workloads and significant processing demands, especially in environments requiring heavy computation, data processing, or high I/O operations.
- **Enhanced Security:** Offers an isolated environment with no "noisy neighbor" effect, reducing risks associated with multi-tenant environments.
- **Support for Legacy Applications:** Can run legacy applications that require direct hardware access or specific configurations that are difficult to achieve with shared VMs.

## 2. Pros and Cons of Using Bare Metal VMs

### Advantages:

1. **Performance:**
   - Direct access to hardware ensures low latency and high performance, ideal for high-computation workloads such as machine learning, scientific computations, and data analytics.
2. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - In environments where workloads are constant and require intensive processing, Bare Metal VMs can be more cost-effective than traditional VMs due to the lack of a virtualization layer and reduced overhead.
3. **Customization and Control:**
   - Offers complete control over the server's environment, including the choice of operating system, software, and configurations.
4. **Security:**
   - Enhanced security due to physical isolation and dedicated resources, reducing vulnerabilities associated with shared environments.
5. **Compliance:**
   - Suitable for industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as healthcare and finance, where data isolation and security are critical.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Provisioning Time:**
   - Setting up Bare Metal VMs can take longer than spinning up standard virtual machines, as the hardware needs to be allocated and configured manually.
2. **Scalability Issues:**
   - While they handle scale within their environment well, they do not scale out as dynamically as cloud-native VMs in multi-tenant environments.
3. **Higher Upfront Costs:**
   - Can have higher initial costs compared to cloud-based VM options, especially if dedicated hardware needs to be purchased or leased.
4. **Limited Flexibility:**
   - Lack of flexibility for dynamic workloads or environments where resources need to be frequently adjusted.
5. **Maintenance Overhead:**
   - Requires more maintenance for hardware, network, and software, potentially increasing operational costs and complexity.

## 3. Examples of Successful Bare Metal VM Implementations

### Example 1: Cloud Gaming Platforms

**Scenario:** Cloud gaming services like NVIDIA GeForce NOW or Google Stadia use Bare Metal VMs to deliver high-performance gaming experiences. These platforms require powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) to render complex game graphics in real time and transmit them to users with minimal latency.

**Why Bare Metal VMs:**
- **Performance:** Direct access to hardware (GPUs) enables rendering of high-quality graphics with low latency.
- **Security:** Dedicated resources ensure data isolation and secure user sessions.
- **Customization:** Customization of the OS and drivers to optimize for specific games or graphics engines.

### Example 2: Financial Trading Platforms

**Scenario:** Financial institutions such as stock exchanges or trading firms deploy trading applications on Bare Metal VMs to ensure fast and reliable processing of high-frequency trading (HFT) transactions.

**Why Bare Metal VMs:**
- **Low Latency:** Millisecond delays can mean significant financial losses; Bare Metal VMs provide the necessary speed and reliability.
- **Customization:** Allows for specific configurations optimized for trading algorithms.
- **Compliance and Security:** Meets strict regulatory requirements regarding data isolation and secure processing.

### Example 3: High-Performance Computing (HPC) in Scientific Research

**Scenario:** Research institutions running simulations or computational models for scientific research (e.g., climate modeling, genomics, etc.) often use Bare Metal VMs for their HPC needs.

**Why Bare Metal VMs:**
- **Performance:** Direct hardware access is critical for handling intensive computational tasks.
- **Scalability:** Can handle significant processing demands by leveraging dedicated resources.
- **Custom Environment:** Enables researchers to configure their software stack and environment for specific applications.

## 4. Practical Example or Demo: Deploying an Application on a Bare Metal VM

### Step-by-Step Example: Deploying a Java Spring Boot Application

To demonstrate how to deploy a Java Spring Boot application on a Bare Metal VM, we can follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Provision a Bare Metal VM

- Use a provider like IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, or your data center.
- Choose a machine with the appropriate CPU, RAM, and storage for your application.

#### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

1. **Install Java:**
```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```
2. **Clone Your Application:**


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-spring-boot-app.git
cd your-spring-boot-app
```
3. **Build the Application:**

```bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean package
```
#### Step 3: Deploy the Application
- Run the Application:

```bash
java -jar target/your-spring-boot-app.jar
```
### Access the Application:

Open a browser and navigate to http://your-server-ip:8080.

## Conclusion
Bare Metal VMs provide a compelling deployment option for applications requiring high performance, security, and customization. They are particularly suitable for scenarios like cloud gaming, financial trading, and scientific research where performance and control are paramount. However, they come with certain limitations, such as longer provisioning times, higher upfront costs, and more maintenance overhead.

By understanding these features, advantages, and limitations, we can better assess if Bare Metal VMs are the right deployment choice for our application needs.
