#### **Project 3: Advanced Cluster Management and Monitoring**

**Objective**: Implement advanced features such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, Persistent Storage, and integrate monitoring tools.

**Steps**:

1. **Set Up Persistent Storage**:
    - Create and apply YAML configurations for PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

2. **Deploy an Application with Persistent Storage**:
    - Modify the deployment YAML to use the PVC for persistent storage.

3. **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**:
    - Create and apply a YAML configuration for HPA based on CPU utilization or other metrics.

4. **Set Up Monitoring and Logging**:
    - **Install Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring metrics.
    - **Install ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.

5. **Verify Autoscaling and Monitoring**:
    - Test autoscaling by generating load and monitor the application using Grafana.
    - Analyze logs with Kibana.

6. **Troubleshooting and Optimization**:
    - Review metrics and logs to identify and resolve issues.

**Outcome**: This project will provide a deep understanding of advanced Kubernetes features and tools for monitoring and managing the cluster.
