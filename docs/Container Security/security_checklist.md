## Container Security Checklist

### 1. Image Security

**1.1. Image Scanning**
- [ ] **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like Docker Scan, Clair, or Trivy to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Regular Scanning**: Schedule regular scans for all images, including those already deployed.
- [ ] **Monitor for Updates**: Keep an eye on vulnerability databases and update images promptly.

**1.2. Image Provenance**
- [ ] **Use Trusted Base Images**: Start from official or trusted base images. Avoid using images from unknown or untrusted sources.
- [ ] **Verify Image Signatures**: Ensure image signatures are verified to validate the authenticity and integrity of the images.

**1.3. Image Hardening**
- [ ] **Minimize Image Size**: Use minimal base images and avoid unnecessary packages to reduce the attack surface.
- [ ] **Remove Unnecessary Tools**: Remove build tools and dependencies that are not needed at runtime.
- [ ] **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Apply multi-stage builds to keep runtime images lean and free from build dependencies.

### 2. Runtime Security

**2.1. Least Privilege**
- [ ] **Non-Root User**: Configure containers to run as non-root users to limit permissions and reduce risk.
- [ ] **File Permissions**: Ensure file and directory permissions within containers follow the principle of least privilege.

**2.2. Resource Limits**
- [ ] **Set CPU and Memory Limits**: Define resource requests and limits in container specifications to prevent resource exhaustion.
- [ ] **Monitor Resource Usage**: Continuously monitor resource usage to detect and address any anomalies.

**2.3. Network Security**
- [ ] **Use Network Policies**: Implement network policies to control traffic flow between containers and restrict access to sensitive services.
- [ ] **Isolate Containers**: Use network segmentation to isolate containers based on their roles and functions.

**2.4. Secrets Management**
- [ ] **Use Secrets Management Tools**: Store sensitive data like passwords and API keys using secrets management solutions (e.g., Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets).
- [ ] **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Do not hardcode secrets into images or environment variables.

### 3. Deployment and Configuration

**3.1. Configuration Management**
- [ ] **Version Control Configurations**: Store container configurations and deployment scripts in version control systems.
- [ ] **Use Configuration Management Tools**: Leverage tools like Helm for Kubernetes to manage configuration in a standardized manner.

**3.2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- [ ] **Automate Security Checks**: Integrate security scans into CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect issues during the build process.
- [ ] **Review Deployment Artifacts**: Regularly review and audit deployment artifacts and configurations for compliance with security policies.

### 4. Monitoring and Incident Response

**4.1. Logging**
- [ ] **Centralize Logging**: Implement centralized logging to collect and manage logs from all containers.
- [ ] **Enable Audit Logs**: Ensure audit logs are enabled for tracking access and changes to containerized environments.

**4.2. Monitoring**
- [ ] **Use Monitoring Tools**: Deploy monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track container performance and detect anomalies.
- [ ] **Set Alerts**: Configure alerts for unusual activities, such as unexpected spikes in resource usage or network traffic.

**4.3. Incident Response**
- [ ] **Develop an Incident Response Plan**: Create and maintain an incident response plan specific to containerized environments.
- [ ] **Conduct Regular Drills**: Regularly practice incident response scenarios to ensure preparedness for security incidents.

### 5. Governance and Compliance

**5.1. Compliance with Standards**
- [ ] **Adhere to Security Standards**: Ensure containerized applications comply with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., NIST, GDPR).
- [ ] **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to verify compliance with security policies and practices.

**5.2. Access Control**
- [ ] **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use RBAC to manage access to container management platforms and resources.
- [ ] **Review Access Rights**: Regularly review and update access rights to ensure that they align with the principle of least privilege.

### 6. Documentation and Training

**6.1. Documentation**
- [ ] **Document Security Policies**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of security policies and procedures for containerized environments.
- [ ] **Update Documentation**: Regularly update documentation to reflect changes in security practices and tools.

**6.2. Training**
- [ ] **Conduct Security Training**: Provide ongoing security training for teams involved in containerization and deployment.
- [ ] **Stay Updated**: Keep teams informed about emerging security threats and best practices.
