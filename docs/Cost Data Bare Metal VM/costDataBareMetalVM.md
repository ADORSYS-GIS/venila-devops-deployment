### 1. Licensing Fees for Virtualization Software

**Bare Metal VMs:**
- **Bare Metal Servers:** These are physical servers dedicated to a single tenant and are not virtualized on the hardware itself. They typically run on hypervisors but don’t inherently require licensing for virtualization if not used.

**Virtualization Software Costs:**
If you're using virtualization software on Bare Metal servers, costs will vary based on the software you choose. Here’s a breakdown:

- **VMware ESXi:**
    - **Free Version:** VMware ESXi offers a free version with limited features.
    - **Paid Versions:** VMware vSphere, which includes ESXi with advanced features, starts at around $995 per CPU for the Standard edition.
    - **Verify Costs:** Visit the [VMware Pricing Page](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/pricing.html) for more details or contact VMware for customized quotes.

- **Microsoft Hyper-V:**
    - **Windows Server:** Hyper-V is included with Windows Server, which costs around $972 for a Standard edition license or $6,157 for a Datacenter edition.
    - **Verify Costs:** Refer to the [Microsoft Windows Server Pricing Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/pricing) for detailed pricing.

- **Red Hat Virtualization:**
    - **Licensing Fees:** Starts at approximately $1,000 per physical server per year.
    - **Verify Costs:** Check the [Red Hat Virtualization Pricing Page](https://www.redhat.com/en/store/red-hat-virtualization) for more information.

### 2. Infrastructure Costs

**Hardware Costs:**
- **Bare Metal Servers:**
    - **Entry-Level Servers:** Typically cost between $1,000 and $3,000.
    - **High-End Servers:** Can range from $5,000 to $15,000 or more, depending on specifications like processors, memory, and storage.
    - **Verify Costs:** Contact hardware vendors like Dell, HP, or Cisco for quotes. Refer to their [Dell Servers Pricing](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/servers-storage-and-networking/sr/servers) or [HP Servers Pricing](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers.html) pages.

- **Networking Equipment:**
    - **Basic Networking Gear:** Includes switches, routers, and cables, costing from $1,000 to $10,000+ depending on capacity and performance.
    - **Verify Costs:** Check with network equipment providers for quotes. Look at [Cisco Networking Equipment Pricing](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/index.html) or [Arista Networks Pricing](https://www.arista.com/en/products).

- **Storage:**
    - **Direct Attached Storage (DAS):** Can range from $1,000 to $5,000 for high-performance storage systems.
    - **Network Attached Storage (NAS) or Storage Area Network (SAN):** Costs can be higher, from $10,000 to $100,000+ for enterprise-grade systems.
    - **Verify Costs:** Contact storage vendors for specific pricing. Refer to [Dell Storage Pricing](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/servers-storage-and-networking/storage) or [NetApp Storage Pricing](https://www.netapp.com/products/storage-systems/).

**Power and Cooling:**
- **Data Center Costs:**
    - **Power and Cooling:** Costs can vary significantly based on location and data center size. This can include electricity, cooling systems, and physical space, potentially ranging from $1,000 to $10,000+ per month.
    - **Verify Costs:** Contact data center providers for estimates. Look at [Equinix Data Center Pricing](https://www.equinix.com/data-centers/) or [Digital Realty Pricing](https://www.digitalrealty.com/).

### 3. Operational Costs

**Management and Maintenance:**
- **Training:**
    - **Technical Training:** Costs for training on specific hardware and software can range from $500 to $3,000 per person.
    - **Verify Costs:** Check training providers like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com), or [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com) for pricing.

**Support:**
- **Vendor Support Contracts:**
    - **Hardware Support:** Vendor support contracts for hardware can cost from $500 to $5,000 per year, depending on the level of support and hardware type.
    - **Verify Costs:** Contact hardware vendors for specific support contract details. Look at [Dell Support Services](https://www.dell.com/support), [HP Support Services](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/services.html), or [Cisco Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html).

**Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
- **Backup Solutions:**
    - **Software Costs:** Backup software can range from $500 to $3,000+ depending on the features and scalability.
    - **Managed Backup Services:** Typically cost $0.01 to $0.05 per GB per month.
    - **Verify Costs:** Check [Veeam Backup Pricing](https://www.veeam.com/backup-replication-pricing.html) or [Acronis Backup Pricing](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/business/backup/) for managed services.
